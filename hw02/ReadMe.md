# Homework hw02:

There are two files, "buttons.py" and "etchasketch.py"

"buttons.py" turns on LEDs connected to GP1 when a buttons on GP0 are pressed. It has provisions for swapping the direction of the signals based on whether a pullup or a pull down is used.

"etchasketch.py" is an etchascketch that is controlled by 4 buttons connected to GP0 to move around. Pressing GP0_4 and GP0_6 at the same time clears the display, pressing GP0_3 and GP0_5 at the same time exits the program.
