# Homework hw02:

There are two files, "buttons.py" and "etchasketch.py"

"buttons.py" turns on LEDs connected to GP1 when a buttons on GP0 are pressed. It has provisions for swapping the direction of the signals based on whether a pullup or a pull down is used.

"etchasketch.py" is an etchascketch that is controlled by 4 buttons connected to GP0 to move around. 
One can change the size from the default 8x8 grid by running the command "python3 etchasketch.py RR CC" where RR and CC represent the number of rows and columns desired
