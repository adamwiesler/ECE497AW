Of the six items below, I have completed all of them. The etch-a-sketch was created in Node

1. installing the latest shipped image on the BeagleBone
2. setting up a host computer with Linux for kernel development
3. gathering all the needed SD cards, cables, etc.
4. installing git on a your host
5. signing up for the two beagle Google groups (See Working With Open Source)
6. writing a simple Etch-a-sketch program


# Etch-A-Sketch:

To run, install neccessary packages by running:

`$bone npm install`

Then, run 

`$bone node etchasketch.js #rows #cols`

replacing #rows and #cols with the number of rows and columns wanted (defaults to 8x8).
